# From design to development, 10 tools I can’t live without

Tools don’t make a craftsman. But they can certainly help. This week, I wanted to introduce you to a few tools that I use. Hopefully, you discover a few new tools to help optimize your workflow.

### [Atom](https://atom.io/)

[Atom](https://atom.io/) is an open source text editor created by Github. For the past year Atom has been my primary editor. Atom comes full-featured with things like a built in package manager, smart auto-completion, and beautiful themes.

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*NJSdVt3FtALxD4uPc6oeZQ.png"&gt;</noscript>







Coming from Sublime, the package manager was a breath of fresh air. With Atom, you can either use [APM](https://github.com/atom/apm) or its GUI interface. No need to modify config files. It just works.

<canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="46"></canvas>

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tLl6qBQB8q8uFSWzVUyzFw.png"&gt;</noscript>







A note on performance. When Atom was first released, it was slow. However today it’s blazing fast. The only slow down I notice is when opening up huge files.

You can read more about Atom and its performance optimizations in [Moving Atom To React](http://blog.atom.io/2014/07/02/moving-atom-to-react.html) and then [Implement text editor DOM updates manually instead of via React](https://github.com/atom/atom/pull/5624).

### [DragDis](https://dragdis.com/)

As a designer, I’m always on the lookout for inspiration. [DragDis](https://dragdis.com/) is a tool that lets me save inspiration as I find it. It’s easy to use. Install the Chrome extension and start dragging.





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*Y-Z5FCjF8vXerLuHU3yQ9w.png?q=20)

<canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="50"></canvas>

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Y-Z5FCjF8vXerLuHU3yQ9w.png"&gt;</noscript>







The way I organize my DragDis folders is by week. Each week I create a new inspiration folder. It’s a great way to track how my design tastes have changed over time.

DragDis also has a full-page grid view. This makes for fantastic moodboards.

### [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/)

[iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html) is a sleek alternative to Terminal. Just to name a few features, iTerm 2 has unlimited split panels, inline images, and search. Although Terminal has a lot of similar functionality, iTerm 2 is constantly improving.

### [Muzli](https://muz.li/)

[Muzli](https://muz.li/) is a Chrome extension that aggregates design related content from sources like Designer News, Dribbble, Behance, etc.





<iframe data-width="854" data-height="480" width="700" height="393" src="/media/a66df417ab5ff9c80009184aadc85ef6?postId=96006445e636" data-media-id="a66df417ab5ff9c80009184aadc85ef6" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>





Every time you open a new tab in Chrome Muzli sources you the best content from each of these sites.

One thing I love is that they have a staff picks section. It’s like having your own personal assistant pick out the best front-end and design related articles.

### [Noiz.io](http://noiz.io/)

A lot of makers like to go to hip coffee shops for the ambiance. [Noizio](http://noiz.io/) helps bring that ambiance to your home. With Noizio, you can choose from a range of background noises including October Rain, Coffee House, Thunderstorm, and Sea Waves. Perfect for getting into the zone.

### [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/)

[Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) is a prototyping and workflow platform, perfect for collaboration between front-ends and designers. Designers can upload series of screens to a project. Then they hot link screens with one another.





![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*oAdjd5Fx50JB8-kro6EcGA.png?q=20)

<canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="46"></canvas>

<noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*oAdjd5Fx50JB8-kro6EcGA.png"&gt;</noscript>







The blue sections are the hot linked areas. If you tap or click on them, they will take you to the next screen. This is a great way for designers to walk clients and developers through the flow. It’s also useful when doing some preliminary qualitative testing with users.

Invision also recently released a new feature called [Boards](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/). Boards allows you to collect inspiration and build moodboards. The biggest difference between this and using [DragDis](https://dragdis.com/) is that Boards is collaborative, so you can work with other team members.

### [What the Font](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/)

Typography is a huge component of design. That’s why [What the Font](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) is one of my favorite chrome extensions. It helps you find out what fonts a site uses. Just point and click.

### [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)

When working as front end developers, we often have to query APIs or interact with our own. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a handy tool that helps you make requests to APIs.

Imagine working on an API endpoint. Instead of having to write a corresponding front-end query or a cURL request, Postman can query the endpoint directly.

### [Wappalyzer](https://wappalyzer.com/)

[Wappalyzer](https://wappalyzer.com/) is a tool for identifying what libraries and frameworks a site uses. It has a Chrome extension and by far is one of the most useful tools for a front-end developer. Next time you wonder what library a site is using to create a specific visualization, Wappalyzer has you covered.

### [Boom 2](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/index.php)

[Boom](http://www.globaldelight.com/boom/index.php) is a volume booster and equalizer for Mac. It’s perfect for when you’re coding and need some tunes to boost your productivity. It has a set of pre-configured profiles for genres like jazz, hip-hop, and dub-step. You can also configure custom profiles.

Boom also includes a set of sound effects. Paired with a pair of headphones [Bose Quiet Comforts](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-25-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones-apple-devices.html) the sound effects make a huge difference in your listening experience.
